    o	cd film_photo_portfolio
    o	npm install
    o	npm run dev
-	open the generated link: http://localhost:3000
    o	!OBS!
        If your local development server is NOT http://localhost:3000 the application will not work, as data are fetched on the    server and depends on the development server. In that case:
        •	Open the project in visual studio code
        •	Navigate to the file .env.local in the root directory
        •	Edit the link to match your local development sever

If having issues pls contact developer on andersdamsgaard95@gmail.com
